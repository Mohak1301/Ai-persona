# Profile Images Setup

## Option 1: Use Generated Placeholder Images

1. Open `generate-profiles.html` in your browser
2. Right-click on each canvas and "Save image as":
   - Save as `hitesh-profile.jpg` for Hitesh
   - Save as `piyush-profile.jpg` for Piyush  
   - Save as `user-profile.jpg` for User

## Option 2: Add Your Own Images

Place your own profile images in this folder with these exact names:
- `hitesh-profile.jpg` - Hitesh's profile picture
- `piyush-profile.jpg` - Piyush's profile picture
- `user-profile.jpg` - User's profile picture

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: 200x200 pixels or larger (will be automatically resized)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1)
- **File Size**: Under 1MB recommended

## Fallback

If images are not found, the app will show colored circles with initials:
- Hitesh: Teal gradient with "H"
- Piyush: Indigo gradient with "P"  
- User: Gray gradient with "U"
